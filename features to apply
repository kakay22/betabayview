Benefit: Helps homeowners stay on top of financial obligations without needing to manually track them.

<!-- 7. Interactive Route Mapping
Feature: Use mapping features like Leaflet (as you're already using) to display key places within the community, like amenities, security outposts, and entry points. Allow users to request visits to other properties.

Benefit: Enhances navigation and supports efficient visit scheduling. -->

<!-- 8. Chatbot for FAQs and Assistance
